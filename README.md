# Welcome to my stuff

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this is to house my projects for my convenience, so nothing is particularly polished, and you're probably going to find some things like project files and non-source stuff scattered around. 
I try to leave things in a working state, but it may not work for you.  

I figured some of this stuff might be useful or interesting to someone, somewhere, so I made select repositories public.  


### Who I am

I am a software developer who got started at the beginning of the home computer revolution in the early 1980s.  I turned the hobby into a career, and over 40 years later, I'm still going.  

And, although I've been doing this by hand for those 40+ years, the introduction of AI-assisted coding has opened up a whole new world. I'm in awe at what these tools can do, and I've become super-fascinated with watching them do their thing. I wrote programs as a young person because I thought it was fascinating to watch these machines do something on their own. With AI development tools, it's still fascinating watching them do something on their own.  

So, you'll probably see more and more generated code here, a product of my desire to create, but do so on a much more efficient level.

```It works on my machine!```
