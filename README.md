I am a software developer who got started at the beginning of the home computer revolution in the early 1980s.  I turned the hobby into a career, and over 40 years later, I'm still going.

My GitHub repositories represent the output of my hobby work.  Some are pet projects I have been working on for many years, others are just little things I have written, mostly to be of service to myself.

Nothing here is particularly polished, and while I try to leave things in a working state, it may not work for you.

```It works on my machine!```
