# Welcome to my stuff

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to house projects that I work on for mostly my own enjoyment and needs... I figure some of this stuff might be useful or interesting to someone, somewhere, so I made select repositories public.  

### Who I am

I am a software developer who got started at the beginning of the home computer revolution in the early 1980s.  I would go to the local department stores that had Atari, Commodore, and Texas Instruments home computer displays and ask the sales clerks for the reference manuals.  I'd thumb through them and taught myself various dialects of BASIC.  My father, out of nowhere, bought me my first computer, a Texas Instruments TI-99/4A, and that started what has been a rewarding hobby and career. Over 40 years later, I'm still going.
