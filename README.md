# Welcome to my stuff

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this is to house my projects for my convenience, so nothing is particularly polished, and you're probably going to find some things like project files and non-source stuff scattered around. 
I try to leave things in a working state, but it may not work for you.  

I figured some of this stuff might be useful or interesting to someone, somewhere, so I made select repositories public.  


### Who I am

I am a software developer who got started at the beginning of the home computer revolution in the early 1980s.  I turned the hobby into a career, and over 40 years later, I'm still going.

```It works on my machine!```
